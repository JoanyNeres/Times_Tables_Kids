Then, a random multiplication operation with factors from 1 to 10 will appear below the machine.
The user will type the answer. If the result is incorrect, the phrase "Try again!" will be displayed.

When clicking on the desired option, a matrix will appear on the screen with the rows and columns representing the multiplication factors.
A fun fact about the result will also be displayed.

Some results have a fun fact that is unique to them.  If there is no unique fun fact for a specific result, the application checks if the result is a palindrome and displays a message accordingly. For numbers that are not palindromes, the fun fact simply states if they are odd or even numbers. The user can click the "restart" button to refresh the page and restart the game, which is the end of the flow.

All the elements are playful, interactive and easy to use, so that kids can learn and have fun.

PS: The page contains animated elements that blink.
